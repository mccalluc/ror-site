## Criteria for inclusion in ROR

The scope of ROR is the "affiliation use case" -  proper description of relationships between contributors, contributions, research sponsors, publishers, and employers. We use "affiliation" to describe any formal relationship between a researcher and an organization associated with researchers, including but not limited to their employer, educator, funder, or scholarly society. We define "research organization" as any organization that conducts, produces, manages, or touches research. 

## Product overview

The vision for a registry of research organizations with unique IDs and associated metadata consists of the following required features:

-   Unique and persistent IDs for organizations in the research community
-   IDs resolve to information about the entity: human- and machine-readable
-   Open API/content negotiation
-   Administrative facility to correct, manage, and crosswalk data, including assertion model and syncing with other PID providers
-   Public data dump
-   Common and uniform metadata set

## Record management and data curation

Organizations change over time, and the management of ROR records accounts for this inevitability. The ROR project team, with input from the Community Advisory Group and other stakeholders, developed a [community-based curation model](/curation) to establish and carry out processes and policies for handling record management and data curation. These processes and policies will cover record creation, modification, redirection, consolidation, and deprecation. The processes and policies will also take into account the need to maintain persistence of ROR IDs and record metadata, to identify record status (e.g., active or deprecated), and to implement an open provenance model that tracks assertion histories. This model also includes open communication channels for registry changes to be requested, and transparent, centralized processes for reviewing and approving these changes.  

## Roadmap

The ROR roadmap is available on [Github](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-roadmap#readme).
