ROR is a collaborative effort driven by multiple organizations and individuals. The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. Wide adoption and support across the scholarly research community is central to ROR's growth, sustainability, and success. The support is balanced across the ROR Community Advisory Group, Signatories, and financial Supporters. Also take a look at the [steering organizations and project teams](/about) who are driving ROR forward, and the adopters who are [integrating ROR IDs](/integrations) in their systems.

|ROR Community Advisors	|ROR Signatories	|ROR Supporters	|

|A broad community advisory group meets to discuss and provide input to the project teams on key aspects such as data curation processes and community engagement. |ROR Signatories have officially signed on to pledge support for adopting and integrating their systems with ROR. 	|ROR supporters are those groups who have donated funds to help the development and adoption of ROR over 2020-2021.	|

## ROR Supporters

All of ROR’s work so far has been completed through in-kind donations from ROR steering organizations. We are committed to ROR for the long-term but we can’t move forward without dedicated community support. We are running a fundraising campaign in order to be able to scale up our operations, hire dedicated staff, and develop and deliver new features, with a plan to launch a paid service tier in 2022 to recover costs while keeping the registry's data open and free.

**ROR aims to raise $175,000 in community contributions over the next two years.** As a supporter, you’ll have an opportunity to be part of this exciting community effort from the beginning and to ensure its long-term growth and success.

### Calling all panthera!

**What kind of animal are you?**
There are four types of big cats in the world that have the ability to ROAR. Our suggested supporter categories are named for these four cats. We welcome and appreciate contributions of all shapes and sizes, however!
