Since its launch in 2019, ROR has been charting a unique path toward sustainability. In this blog post, we want to provide an update for the community on where this path is taking us.

## Background
ROR itself is not an organization and does not intend to become one. It launched, and continues to exist, as a collaborative initiative led by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite. Our three organizations share responsibility for ROR’s governance and strategic decision-making, and have committed in-kind resources for ROR’s operations. We formalized this collaboration in a Memorandum of Agreement signed in 2020.

While ROR is a small operation with low overhead, it still requires resources to be successful and sustainable, especially as more stakeholders depend upon it. As adoption has grown and ROR has matured, infrastructure costs have risen with more usage of the ROR API, and the ROR team has expanded to be able to support ROR’s technical development, user community, and curation activities.

One of the challenges ROR has faced over the past few years is how to develop a long-term sustainability model that ensures the necessary resourcing for ROR to grow and be successful, while remaining a small-scale, community-based, low-overhead operation.

## Journey to sustainability
To address ROR's resourcing needs, we have pursued and considered different directions for sustainability, including community fundraising, grants, and future paid services, to complement the limited in-kind support ROR has had from its three operating organizations.

Today, we are excited to announce that ROR is continuing on its path toward sustainability by formalizing a resourcing model based exclusively on long-term support from its three operating organizations, as opposed to relying on outside revenue sources as well. This is not a major change from the status quo, but it is a significant development in that it clarifies our strategy going forward and addresses some questions and uncertainties about the future.

In short, what this means is that ROR’s governing organizations are re-committing to ROR and have agreed to share full responsibility for covering ROR’s core operating costs. It also means that ROR is not currently planning to cover its costs by relying on revenue from future paid services or grant funds.

## How we got here
How did we arrive at this point? A few factors were key in this process.

First of all, we acknowledged that paid services would take time and resources to scope and develop, and would distract from supporting core functionality. Moreover, given ROR’s aim to provide a freely and openly available solution to the problem of identifying research affiliations, a paid service is not necessarily ideal. We did not want to invest time and resources in developing paid services just for the sake of doing so.

Second, in line with our commitment to the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure, we did not want to be dependent on grants for long-term and/or core operating expenses. (We remain very  grateful to IMLS and NSF for supporting key development work over the past two years to support curation and adoption)

Lastly, while community fundraising has been successful, it has not proven to be sufficient for covering all expenses. It also requires a lot of overhead to administer. We have also experienced challenges in obtaining contributions for something that is ostensibly “free”.

Other potential revenue-generation options that might be relevant in other situations were never on the table for ROR - i.e., ROR was not set up to become a separate membership organization.
This experience led to a realization of how ROR is inextricably tied to our three organizations’ strategic goals, and vice versa.

ROR will only be successful if we see widespread inclusion of ROR IDs in DataCite and Crossref metadata. Likewise, DataCite and Crossref benefit from having the clean and consistent affiliation data that ROR IDs provide.

ROR’s success depends on institutions such as California Digital Library leveraging and advocating for ROR IDs in publishing workflows, publisher agreements, citation databases, and research information systems. California Digital Library likewise benefits from the open availability of affiliation metadata that allows for University of California research outputs to be discoverable.

Therefore, we realized that the optimal way to position ROR for success and sustainability would be for our organizations to commit to supporting ROR independently. With this approach, we can set up ROR for long-term resourcing, free up time and focus by not pursuing additional revenue-generation options, and remove uncertainties about being able to fund staff roles or infrastructure costs in the future.

## Looking ahead: What’s next?
While the mechanics of ROR’s sustainability model have evolved, ROR’s core activities have not. The ROR team will continue with its activities already underway and in consultation with the community.

To formalize our organizations’ commitment to ROR, we have updated the memorandum of agreement that guides our collaboration, and we have [published this document on the ROR website].

It is important that ROR continues to be a community-driven and community-supported initiative.
A wide network of community stakeholders around the world have helped to support ROR’s growth over the past few years by building integrations, raising awareness, providing feedback on future directions, and contributing funds to help ROR grow. Investments from community stakeholders are a key part of signaling the value and importance of ROR as shared open infrastructure. While ROR’s operating organizations are committing to fund the registry’s core expenses, any additional contributions from community supporters wishing to invest in ROR will be used to offset operating costs and support special projects and initiatives.

Thank you to the many organizations and individuals that have helped ROR get to this point and that are continuing to join us on this journey!
