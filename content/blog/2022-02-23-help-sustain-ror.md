## **ROR begins a new round of community fundraising**

This month, ROR is launching a new round of community fundraising. Building on the community fundraising campaign we ran during 2019-2021, we are renewing a call for organizations to contribute to ROR. We are also opening up more ways for organizations to participate in the collective funding of ROR.

## **ROR Sustaining Supporters program**

Organizations are encouraged to support ROR on a recurring annual basis as Sustaining Supporters. Any organization that signs up to support ROR through the end of 2022 will be recognized as a Founding Supporter and receive a supporter badge that can be displayed on their website.

Organizations can support ROR starting at $100 per year. To simplify the invoicing process, organizations that are already members of Crossref or DataCite can receive an invoice from Crossref and DataCite for ROR contributions. Organizations can also be invoiced directly from ROR.

## **Why ROR needs your support**

As a collaborative initiative that is [led and supported by multiple organizations and individuals](https://ror.org/governance), ROR is dependent on growing and sustaining community participation. ROR is funded through a combination of in-kind support from its three operating organizations, time-limited grant funds (currently running through the end of 2022), and community contributions. Community support for ROR takes non-fiduciary forms as well: this includes the adopters who integrate ROR in various systems, the stakeholders who participate in community discussions, and the community members who help coordinate the registry's curation activities.

While ROR aims to minimize overhead and contain costs, it still requires resources to build and maintain the registry's infrastructure, especially as adoption continues to grow. Since ROR launched in 2019, we have been charting a path to sustainability that leverages our broad community network and diversifies our funding sources. ROR has been working to establish independent revenue streams that complement ROR's in-kind support from its operating organizations, avoid dependence on funds, and ensure the registry data remains openly available.

The Sustaining Supporters program is the next step in ROR's sustainability journey. ROR is continuing to explore potential paid service offerings to be released later that would complement the supporters program. Any paid services would not impact the availability of ROR data, in line with our commitment to the [Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/).

## **Join us!**Â 

ROR aims to be an example of the power and potential of community-funded open infrastructure. ROR is committed to providing open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata enables more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.

We've all seen key infrastructure components disappear, be enclosed or acquired. So we're also realistic about how much effort and cost are involved in sustaining key components of open infrastructure that the scholarly community depends on. And in doing this right. That means not just sustaining, but investing in them so that they can evolve alongside community needs.

This is an exciting moment to be part of ROR's growth. Let's fund open infrastructure together!
